## A website that is well optized and follows all accessibility standards

In this project I worked on making a website that followed all accessibility standards and is optimized for the search engiene. To start things off I went throughout the webpage looking for any accessibility issues I could fix, some things I was able to find were no alt tags for the images I also noticed contrast issues with the text in the aside section, and no landmarks to organize the website. 

### Corrected errors
-Nav bar buttons(they now take you to a corresponding location)

-Alt tags given to the images(Gives them a description and allows google to read the website better resulting in a more optimzed website for the search engiene)

-Landmarks added ex. Nav, Main, Aside, Section, Footer.

-Fixed contrast issues with the aside bar allowing for better visibity for people with impairments.

-Condensed CSS files to look cleaner and more organized.
